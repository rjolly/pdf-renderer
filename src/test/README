To test on a file, cd to this directory and type:

% java SlideIndex <path_to_pdf_file>

or

% java Presenter <path_to_pdf_file>

Note that there are many, many pdf files that either won't render correctly,
throw exceptions, or render mostly correctly except for some odd characters.
Please note those files, and let us know about what went wrong, or dig into
the code and fix it yourself.  I don't suggest the latter until we get around
to documenting the code.  :)
